# Security policy

## Supported versions

We currently support only the latest tagged pre-1.0 release line of BubuStack Helm charts.

| Version line | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Latest tagged chart release | Supported | Security fixes land here first while the project is pre-1.0. |
| Older tagged releases | Unsupported | Upgrade to the newest chart release before requesting a security fix. |
| Unreleased commits on `main` or feature branches | Unsupported | Security fixes are released through tagged versions, not guaranteed on arbitrary commits. |

We aim to support Kubernetes N-2 relative to upstream stable releases, but this repository does not yet publish a separate compatibility matrix. Treat the latest release notes and the currently tested CI workflows as the source of truth for supported environments.

We do not currently publish a PGP key for vulnerability intake. Use the GitHub Security Advisory flow below so reports stay private.

## Reporting a vulnerability

The BubuStack Team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the GitHub Security Advisory feature in this repository:

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide the following information:

- **A clear description** of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability, including any example code, scripts, or configurations.
- **The version(s) of the chart** affected.
- **Your contact information** for us to follow up with you.

2.  **Confirmation**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
3.  **Investigation**: We will investigate the vulnerability and determine its scope and impact. We may contact you for additional information during this phase.
4.  **Fix**: We will develop a patch for the vulnerability.
5.  **Disclosure**: We will create a security advisory, issue a CVE (if applicable), and release a new version with the patch. We will credit you for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
